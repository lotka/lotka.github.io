<h2 id="brene-brown-books">Brene Brown Books</h2>
<p>Fascinating books about psychology, Brene Brown has spent hundreds of hours taking to people and trys to condense the thought patterns of the people who seem to be living good lives into simple rules. ## The Golden House - Salman Rushdie A crazy novel where this family called the Golden family move from India to New York City. It addresses identity, politics and gender in contemporary America. The reviews seem to be very mixed. ## Addiction - Russell Brand ## Homo Prospectus - Martin E. P. Seligman</p>
